HdT
===

A handy PdF viewer with the possibility to scribble over pages.
Uses `SVG` overlays editable with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

Installation
------------

The command line tools [pdftocairo](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/poppler-utils/pdftocairo.1.en.html) and
[xmlstarlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLStarlet) should be installed.

And [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

To build and install `hdt`, run `cabal install` in this directory.

Configuration
-------------

The sample configuration file `hdt.dhall` should be copied to `~/.config/hdt/config.dhall`.


Use

### Two files and a folder

Suppose that we are looking at a `.pdf` file, _e.g._ :

    /home/andrei/papers/paper.pdf

When we first run `hdt` on this file, it will create an `XML` file with the extension `.pdq`. Now we have two files:

    /home/andrei/papers/paper.pdf
    /home/andrei/papers/paper.pdq

The `.pdq` file contains bookmarks and notes. If we also want to scribble over, we create a folder with the extension `.hdt`;
now we have two files and a folder:

    /home/andrei/papers/paper.pdf
    /home/andrei/papers/paper.pdq
    /home/andrei/papers/paper.hdt/

### Scribble over pages with Inkscape

To create an __SVG overlay__ over page 3, do this:

    cd /home/andrei/papers/paper.hdt/
    hdt -e 3
    inkscape p3.svg &

While drawing in Inkscape, make sure that you draw on the layer with the id: `layer1`. This should be automatic, just double-check.
It is the `layer1` that becomes the overlay, when viewing the `paper.pdf`.
The overlays are all in `paper.hdt/`, named `p<n>.svg`, where `n` is the page number.

### Global setting can be overwritten on a per-pdf-file basis

To ovewrite settings, put the corresponding keys in  `/home/andrei/papers/paper.hdt/config.dhall`. For example:

    {
     initialScale = 1.3
     }

-- this will overwrite the `initialScale` setting in `~/.config/hdt/config.dhall` specially for the `paper.pdf` file.

### Working with bookmarks

    Add bookmark                              a
    Open bookmarks                            Ctrl-b

Bookmarks are labelled by letters ("charhints", like in [Tridactyl](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/)).
To navigate to the bookmark, press the corresponding key. To delete the bookmark, press that key with `Shift` (like upcase).

### Notes and annotations

Notes (as bookmarks) are stored in the `.pdq` file, while annotations are stored in the `.pdf` file itself.
(Annotations are a standard feature of `PDF` files, while notes are a feature of `hdt`.)

Both are work in progress, for now.
